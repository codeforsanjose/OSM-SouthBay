# OSM-SouthBay

This is project towards improving the quality of [OSM data in the South Bay](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/South_Bay_%28SF%29,_California) as well as improving the community!

Mappers in the South Bay need to meet each other!

Thus we are listing issues of things to work on in the South Bay as well as steps towards creating a community.

## What is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/37.3358/-121.8906)?
OpenStreetMap is open data: Open Maps.  you are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OpenStreetMap 
and its contributors. 

A better OpenStreetMap will make a difference for tripplanners, mappers, planners, and businesses!
