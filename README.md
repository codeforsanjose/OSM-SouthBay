# OpenStreetMap in the South Bay

We develop and maintain [OpenStreetMap’s coverage of San José and surrounding Santa Clara County](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/37.3358/-121.8906). Together as volunteers with Code for San José, we’re working to ensure that all South Bay residents have adequate representation on the map and benefit from the community-based and commercial services in the OpenStreetMap ecosystem. This repository tracks our editing campaigns, including easy ways to get started, and contains code for carrying out our data imports, so that other local mapping communities can build on our work.

## About OpenStreetMap

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) is an open-source project collecting all the data needed for making a worldwide, street-level map of the world and putting it in a single database. You are welcome to contribute to the project as a mapper, field surveyor, or developer. You can also reuse the data in a myriad of ways based on an open source license. Because of its openness, OSM is often described as the “Wikipedia of maps”. OSM is a useful resource on its own, as infrastructure for other civic tech projects, and as a low-barrier way for anyone to get involved with civic tech.

To get in touch with other Bay Area mappers and the broader U.S. mapper community, invite yourself to the [OSMUS Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/) workspace and join the [#local-california](https://osmus.slack.com/archives/CCN1KJ76U) channel. There is also [a low-volume mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us-sfbay/) and [additional documentation on the OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California).
