# OpenStreetMap in the South Bay

We develop and maintain [OpenStreetMap‚Äôs coverage of San Jos√© and surrounding Santa Clara County](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/37.3358/-121.8906). Together as volunteers with Open Source San Jos√©, we‚Äôre working to ensure that all South Bay residents have adequate representation on the map and benefit from the community-based and commercial services in the OpenStreetMap ecosystem. This repository tracks our editing campaigns, including easy ways to get started, and contains code for carrying out our data imports, so that other local mapping communities can build on our work.

## About OpenStreetMap

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) is an open-source project collecting all the data needed for making a worldwide, street-level map of the world and putting it in a single database. You are welcome to contribute to the project as a mapper, field surveyor, or developer. You can also reuse the data in a myriad of ways based on an open source license. Because of its openness, OSM is often described as the ‚ÄúWikipedia of maps‚Äù. OSM is a useful resource on its own, as infrastructure for other civic tech projects, and as a low-barrier way for anyone to get involved with civic tech.

To get started with OpenStreetMap, go to [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and create a free user account. Once you‚Äôve logged in, zoom into your neighborhood and click the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button at the top of the page. Spend a few minutes completing the interactive tutorial to get a feel for editing, then dive in and add missing details to your neighborhood. If you‚Äôd rather edit from your phone, download [Vespucci](https://vespucci.io/) for Android or [Go Map!!](https://apps.apple.com/app/id592990211) for iOS. To contribute while you‚Äôre out and about, download [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) (Android only) or [Every Door](https://every-door.app/) and fill in details about your surroundings, or download [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/mobile-apps) for Android or iOS and capture street-level imagery that makes it easier to edit at home.

If you‚Äôre interested in local history or genealogy, also check out OSM‚Äôs sister project, [OpenHistoricalMap](https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/#map=12/37.3355/-121.8906). It‚Äôs just getting off the ground but will eventually depict the evolution of places like San Jos√© over time.

To get in touch with other Bay Area mappers and the broader U.S. mapper community, invite yourself to the [OSMUS Slack](https://slack.openstreetmap.us/) workspace and join the [#local-california](https://osmus.slack.com/archives/CCN1KJ76U) channel. There is also [a low-volume mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us-sfbay/) and [additional documentation on the OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California).
